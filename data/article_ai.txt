Artificial intelligence is the study of computer systems that can perform tasks
normally requiring human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning,
problem solving, and understanding natural language.

In recent years, AI has moved from research labs into everyday life. Recommendation
systems, voice assistants, and automated translation tools are all examples of
applied artificial intelligence. As computing power increases, AI systems continue
to grow more capable and more widespread.
