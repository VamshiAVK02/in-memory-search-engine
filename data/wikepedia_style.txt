The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and the fifth-largest moon in the Solar System.
It plays a significant role in stabilizing Earth's axial tilt, which affects climate.

The Moon's surface is covered with craters formed by asteroid impacts.
Humans first landed on the Moon in 1969 during NASA's Apollo 11 mission.
