The Roman Empire was one of the largest civilizations in ancient history.
At its height, it stretched across Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia.

Roman engineering achievements included roads, aqueducts, and public buildings.
Many modern legal systems and political ideas trace their origins back to Roman law
and governance structures.
